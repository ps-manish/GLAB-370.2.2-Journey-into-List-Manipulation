### Step 1: Introduction

Let's kickstart our adventure by diving into the incredible world of **list manipulation**. In this lab, we'll explore various techniques to create, access, modify, and operate on lists, unravelling the true potential of this versatile data structure!

### Step 2: Creating and Accessing Lists

Before we delve deeper, let's review the basics of creating and accessing lists. We'll cover techniques for creating lists, accessing individual elements, and retrieving portions of a list.

```python
# Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Accessing individual elements
first_fruit = fruits[0]
print("First Fruit:", first_fruit)

# Retrieving portions of a list
selected_fruits = fruits[1:3]
print("Selected Fruits:", selected_fruits)
```

### Step 3: Modifying Lists

Now, let's explore techniques to modify lists. We'll cover adding elements, removing elements, and changing existing elements within a list.

```python
# Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

# Adding elements
numbers.append(4)
print("After Append:", numbers)

# Removing elements
numbers.remove(2)
print("After Remove:", numbers)

# Changing elements
numbers[0] = 5
print("After Change:", numbers)
```

### Step 4: List Operations

List manipulation becomes even more powerful when we explore various list operations. We'll cover techniques such as sorting, counting elements, and finding the length of a list.

```python
# Example:
numbers = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]

# Sorting a list
numbers.sort()
print("Sorted List:", numbers)

# Counting elements
count = numbers.count(4)
print("Count of 4:", count)

# Finding the length of a list
length = len(numbers)
print("Length of List:", length)
```

### Step 5: Challenge

Now it's time for an exciting challenge! Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers. Perform the following operations on the list:

1. Sort the list in ascending order.
2. Remove any duplicates from the list.
3. Print the modified list.

### Step 6: Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the "List Master: Journey into List Manipulation" guided lab! You've gained valuable insights into the world of list manipulation and learned how to harness the power of lists in Python.

Remember to keep practicing and exploring new concepts. Lists are incredibly versatile data structures that offer limitless possibilities in various programming tasks!
